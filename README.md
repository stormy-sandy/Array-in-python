# Array-in-python
Data structure

numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(numbers[0])
 
#random indexing --> 0(1) get item if we know the index !!!
#print(numbers[4])
 

numbers[1] = 'Adam'
 
#output :[1,Adam,3,4,5]






An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

car1 = "Ford"
car2 = "Volvo"
car3 = "BMW"
However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?

The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.
